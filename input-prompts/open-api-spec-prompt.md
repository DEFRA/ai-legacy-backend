# Task: Iteratively Expand OpenAPI Specification for User Story

Create or expand an OpenAPI 3.1.1 specification to support a specific user story in my tbcms project. This is an iterative development process where the specification grows incrementally with each user story implementation. Reference the official OpenAPI Specification v3.1.1 from https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.1.html

**Note**: This specification is for development validation purposes. Use v1 as the API version throughout development until all user stories are implemented.

## Context Documents
You have access to the following design documentation:
1. `mongo-erd.md` - Database ERD showing structure and business entities
2. `[SPECIFY USER STORY FILE]` - The specific user story to implement
3. `documentation/` folder - System design and documentation

## Analysis Requirements
1. Review the specified user story and associated system documentation
2. Understand all business logic and entities for this project
3. Identify the API endpoints needed to support the user story
4. **If an existing OpenAPI specification exists, extend it rather than replacing it**

## Design Principles
1. DO NOT tightly couple the API design to the database structure
2. Follow RESTful API design best practices and principles
3. Design for the user story requirements, not database convenience
4. Build incrementally - add only what's needed for the current user story

## Output Requirements
1. Use OpenAPI Specification v3.1.1 format
2. Output MUST be in YAML format
3. Focus only on endpoints needed for the specified user story
4. **Iterative approach**: If this is the first user story, create a complete new specification. If extending an existing spec, clearly indicate what's being added or modified
5. Include comments in the YAML to identify which endpoints/schemas support the current user story

## Development Context
This OpenAPI specification serves as:
- A development tool for validating API design against user story requirements  
- A reference for code generation and implementation
- An incremental documentation that grows with each user story

Each iteration should build upon the previous specification, creating a comprehensive API definition that supports all implemented user stories.
